# HW03-PasswordGenerator

This password generator prompts the user (when a button is clicked) to choose the length of the password, and then they are prompted to to choose between which character set they want to use. If the user chooses a set with 'character' in the name then they are prompter with whether they would like their alphabetical components of the password to be lowercase or uppercase. During this assignment I leanred for to use conditional loops, how to correctly use '||' and '&&' properly with multiple checks, and how to construct function and call it / calling within an event listener.

Here are the character optins that the usercan choose from:

* character
* numeric
* special
* charater+numeric
* character+special
* numeric+special
* character+special+numeric

'character' options have the option of:

* uppercase
* lowercase
